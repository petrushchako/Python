# Demo: Using the Default Python Interpreter and the iPython Interpreter

### Default Python Interpreter
- Launched by running `python` (or `python3`) in the terminal.
- Features:
  - Can execute Python code line by line.
  - Example:

    ```python
    print("Python Course")
    ```
  - Variables work normally, e.g.:

    ```python
    name = input("What is your name? ")
    print(name)
    ```
  - **Limitations**:
    - No tab completion.
    - No command history search.
    - Cannot run shell commands directly (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd` cause errors).
    - Must use modules like `os` for system operations:

      ```python
      import os
      print(os.getcwd())
      ```
    - Cannot clear the screen directly.

### iPython Interpreter
- Launched by running `ipython` in the terminal (after installation).
- Enhanced features:
  - **Colorized syntax highlighting** → makes code easier to read.
  - **Shell command support** → can run commands like:

    ```bash
    !ls
    !pwd
    !clear
    ```
  - **Auto-completion** → pressing `Tab` suggests methods, variables, and modules.
  - **Command history navigation** → arrow keys recall previous commands.
  - Easier interactive exploration of modules:

    ```python
    import os
    os.u<Tab>   # shows available functions starting with "u"
    ```
  - Example with `psutil`:

    ```python
    import psutil
    psutil.disk_usage('/')
    ```

### Key Differences

| Feature                 | Default Python Interpreter | iPython                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Syntax highlighting     | No                         | Yes                       |
| Tab completion          | No                         | Yes                       |
| Shell command support   | No                         | Yes (`!command`)          |
| Command history recall  | Limited                    | Enhanced                  |
| Interactive exploration | Minimal                    | Rich (`Tab`, suggestions) |

### Summary
- **Default interpreter** → lightweight, always available, minimal functionality.
- **iPython** → enhanced interactivity with auto-completion, syntax highlighting, shell integration, and better usability.
- Recommendation: use **iPython** (or Jupyter) for experimentation and learning, and the default interpreter for quick checks or scripting basics.
