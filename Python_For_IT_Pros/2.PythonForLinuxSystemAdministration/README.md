# Python for Linux System Administration

System administrators invariably write scripts to help automate the work they do, but rarely have time to learn a language from top to bottom. They just need enough to get the job done. In this course, Python for Linux System Administrators, you'll quickly get immersed into the Python language in the context of realistic system administration tasks.
- First, you'll survey the various development environments and learn the core language features. 
- Next, you'll meet the key library modules that allow Python scripts to interact with the rest of the Linux system. 
- Finally, you'll explore processing and modifying text files. 

When you're finished with this course, you'll have the skills to write simple sysadmin scripts in Python and have an understanding of the "pythonic" mindset for administering Linux systems.
