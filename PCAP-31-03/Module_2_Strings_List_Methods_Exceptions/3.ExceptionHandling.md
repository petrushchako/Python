## The try and except Blocks
- The order of `except` blocks matters. <br>If you define `except Exeption` above `except NameError` and NameError error occures, the **except Exception** block will be executed, and try-catch block will be closed. However Python requires the `except` block to be the last one in the list.  

```python
# Example 1
try:
    print(variable)
except Exception:
    print("")
except NameError:
    print("Variable is not defined") # This will be printed
except:           # Can only be the last value in try-catch
    print("Something went wrong") 

# Example 2
try:
    print(variable)
except Exception:
    print("Something went wrong") # This will be executed
except NameError:
    print("Variable is not defined")
except:
    print("Something went wrong")
```


## Defining Custom Exception Handlers

```python
atempts = 0

while True:
    try:
        input_var = input("Please enter a number: ")
        input_var = int(input_var)
        break
    
    except ValueError:
        attempts += 1

        if attempts < 3:
            print("Opps! That was not a valid number. Try again . . .")
        else:
            print("You really want to input a string! Fine we'll handle it")
            input_var = str(input_var)
            break
```

## The Exception Hierarchy

```python
import time, datetime

try:
    print(datetime.datetime.now())
    time.sleep(5)
    print(datetime.datetime.now())

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Process has been manually canceled")

```
### Exception with file handling

```python
try:
    file = open("non_existen_file", "r")
except OSError:
    print("OSError occured") # Superset of FileNotFoundError
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File does not exist") # Subset of OSError

```

### Open not existing variable
```python
try:
    print(var)
except NameError:
    print("Variable name")
finally:
    print("Gracefully exiting the try-except-finally block")

var = "Hello there"

try:
    print(var)
except NameError:
    print("Variable name")
finally:
    print("Gracefully exiting the try-except-finally block")
```

### Omitting the except block
- If any error occures within the try block, finally block will not be executed. You need to catch error and then finally will execute.
- If no error occures in try block, then finally will be executed. 
- In the example below, **finally** block is used to close the file.

```python
try:
    file = open('../TEST/Linux/test.py', "r")
    print(file.read())
finally:
    print("Closing the file")
    file.close()
    print(f"File closed : {file.closed}")
```

## Chaining except Blocks
- The code in `else` block is only executed when no exception has been raised. 
- You can place `else` block within the `try` block, but it is recommended to only keep the code that can raise the exception inside of the `try` block.

```python
try:
    file=open("testfile.txt")
    file.write ("Writing to the open file")
except:
    print("Oops! Something went wrong")
else:
    print("Nothing went wrong")
```
- `else` runs if `try` successful (except is skipped)
- if `try` fails, only `except` will run
- `else` is like `finally` but that will only execute if try is success.


**TypeError, ValueError and NameError**
```python
a = 1
b = "Two"

# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
c = a + b + d 

# NameError: name 'd' is not defined
c = str(a) + b + d 

#ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10:'Two'
c = a + int(b) + d

d 
```

## Raising Exceptions

```python
number = int(input("Enter a number:"))
try:
    if number > 5:
      raise Exception(f"The number should not exceed 5. The value of number is: {number}")
except Exception as e:
    print("Caught this ERROR: ", e)
```
## Exception Payloads

```python
import errno, os

for i in dir(errno):
    print(i)
def check_file(filepath):
    if not os.path.isfile(filepath):
        raise FileNotFoundError # Not recommended

try:
    check_file('invalid.path')
except FileNotFoundError as exception:
    print('#1 Handled FileNotFoundError:', exception) 
    ## OUTPUT:
    ##      #1 Handled FileNotFoundError: 

def check_file_message(filepath):
    if not os.path.isfile(filepath):
        raise FileNotFoundError('"%s" not found' % filepath)

try:
    check_file_message('invalid.path')
except FileNotFoundError as exception:
    print('#2 Handled FileNotFoundError:', exception)
    ## OUTPUT:
    ##      #2 Handled FileNotFoundError: "invalid.path" not found


def check_file_args(filename) :
    if not os.path.isfile(filename):
        raise FileNotFoundError(errno.ENOENT, os. strerror (errno. ENOENT), 
                                filename, 2, 'filename2')

try:
    check_file_args('invalid.path')
except FileNotFoundError as exception:
    print('#3 Handled FileNotFoundError:', exception)
    print('Arguments of exception:', exception.args)
    ## OUTPUT
    ## #3 Handled FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'invalid.path' -> 'filename2'
    ## Arguments of exception: (2, 'No such file or directory')
```
