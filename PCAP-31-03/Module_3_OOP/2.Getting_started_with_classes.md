Python Classes & Inheritance: Getting Started with Classes in Python

- discover the key concepts covered in this course
- create a classes using Python
- assign attributes to objects of classes
- initialize class variables using the init special method
- pass arguments to initialize the state of a class object
- define additional methods in a class
- recall how class variables work
- recall how class variables are different from instance variables
- recall how class variables share memory across objects of a class
- work with variables that have their own memory in each object
- define getters and setters for each instance variable
- prevent inadvertent modification of instance variables
- create a class to represent a real-world entity
- parse information to create classes using a dictionary
- describe the use of the init method in a class, specify why the self argument is passed to methods in a class, differentiate between class and instance variables, and specify how member variables can be made private
