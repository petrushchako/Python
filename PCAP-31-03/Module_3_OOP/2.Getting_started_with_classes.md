Python Classes & Inheritance: Getting Started with Classes in Python

- discover the key concepts covered in this course
- create a classes using Python
- assign attributes to objects of classes
- initialize class variables using the init special method
- pass arguments to initialize the state of a class object
- define additional methods in a class
- recall how class variables work
- recall how class variables are different from instance variables
- recall how class variables share memory across objects of a class
- work with variables that have their own memory in each object
- define getters and setters for each instance variable
- prevent inadvertent modification of instance variables
- create a class to represent a real-world entity
- parse information to create classes using a dictionary
- describe the use of the init method in a class, specify why the self argument is passed to methods in a class, differentiate between class and instance variables, and specify how member variables can be made private

## Classes as Custom Data Types
- To create new data type, you have to use classes. <br>Class creation syntax:

```python
    class Student:
        pass
```
```python
    type(Student)
    # Return: type
```
- Creating an object of type Student<br>
Instantiating an object, creating an instance
`object_1 = Student()`

- Object address location:<br>
Location in your machine's memory where Python has placed this object
  
  ```python
    print(object_1)

    # ‹_main__•Student at 0x1120d2400>
  ```
- Check origin of the class
  ```python
    isinstance(object_1, Student)
  ```
