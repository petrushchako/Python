# Object Oriented programming

## The foundations of OOP
- Python is a universal tool for both object and procedural programming.
- Procedural vs. the object-oriented approach

  In the procedural approach, it's possible to distinguish two different and completely separate worlds: the world of data, and the world of code. The world of data is populated with variables of different kinds, while the world of code is inhabited by code grouped into modules and functions.

  The object approach suggests a completely different way of thinking. The data and the code are enclosed together in the same world, divided into classes.
  Every class is like a recipe which can be used when you want to create a useful object (this is where the name of the approach comes from). You may produce as many objects as you need to solve your problem.

### Inheritance
- Let's define one of the fundamental concepts of object programming, named inheritance. Any object bound to a specific level of a class hierarchy inherits all the traits (as well as the requirements and qualities) defined inside any of the superclasses.

  The object's home class may define new traits (as well as requirements and qualities) which will be inherited by any of its subclasses.


### What does an object have?
  The object programming convention assumes that every existing object may be equipped with three groups of attributes:
  - an object has a **name** that uniquely identifies it within its home namespace (although there may be some anonymous objects, too)
  - an object has a **set of individual properties** which make it original, unique, or outstanding (although it's possible that some objects may have no properties at all)
  - an object has a **set of abilities to perform specific activities**, able to change the object itself, or some of the other objects.
