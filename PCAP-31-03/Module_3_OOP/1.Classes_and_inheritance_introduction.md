3 Python Classes and Inheritance: Introduction

- discover the key concepts covered in this course
- recall how state and behavior can be encapsulated in a single unit
- describe how classes can be used as blueprints to create objects
- compare objects and instances to classes
- model is-a relationships using inheritance
- describe the advantages of using object-oriented programming
- describe classes, define how state and behavior of a class are represented, list the characteristics of class objects or instances, describe class inheritance, and list the advantages of object-oriented programming with classes


## Classes

- The blueprint gives you a template for the attributes a house may have and actions associated with a house
- Classes enable objects to have state (attribures) and behaviour (actions).



## Object
- Create an object of a class - the object has attributes and can perform actions
- Object is the same as instance - terms used interchangeably
- **Attributes**<br>
Attributes are properties of a class that represent its state and define its characteristics<br><br>
- There are two types of varaibles:
  - **Class variables** 
     - are associated with a class itself. Ususally holds information that holds information about all objects (static variables)
     - declared outside of any method
     - referred to by the class name
  - **Instance variables** 
     - are associated with the instance of the class.
     - typically declared within methods
     -  referred using the `self` keyword-  
<br>
- Instantiating a class = creating an object of a class
- Each object of a class resides in a different location in memory
- Syntax:<br>
  Create varaible **Student** and assign name of the class with parentasis **Student()**<br><br>
  `Student = Student()`
