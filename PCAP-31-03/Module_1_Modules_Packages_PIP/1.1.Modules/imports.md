## Import

<br>
1. If you want to import a module as a whole, you can do it using the import module name
statement. You are allowed to import more than one module at once using a comma-separated
list. 
For example:

```python
import mod
import mod2, mod3, mod4
```

Although the latter form is not recommended due to stylistic reasons, and it's better and prettier to express the same intention in more a verbose and explicit form, such as:

```python
import mod2
import mod3
import mod4
```

&nbsp;<br>
2. If a module is imported in the above manner and you want to access any of its entities, you
need to prefix the entity's name using dot notation. 

For example:
```python
import my_module
result = my_module.my_function(my_module.my_data)
```
The snippet makes use of two entities coming from the my module module: a function named ```my_function()``` and a variable named ```my_data```. Both names must be prefixed by ```my_module```. None of the imported entity names conflicts with the identical names existing in
your code's namespace.

&nbsp;<br>
3. You are allowed not only to import a module as a whole, but to import only individual entities
from it. In this case, the imported entities must not be prefixed when used. 
For example:
```python
from module import my_function, my_data
result = my_function(my_data)
```
The above way - despite its attractiveness - is not recommended because of the danger of
causing conflicts with names derived from importing the code's namespace.

&nbsp;<br>
4. The most general form of the above statement allows you to import all entities offered by a
module:
```python
from my module import *
result = my_function(my_data)
```

#### Note: this import's variant is not recommended due to the same reasons as previously (the threat of a naming conflict is even more dangerous here).


&nbsp;<br>
5. You can change the name of the imported entity "on the fly" by using the **as** phrase of the import For example:

```python
from module import my function as fun, my data as dat
result = fun(dat)
```
