# Congratulations! You have completed PE2: Module 1.

Well done! You've reached the end of Module 1 and completed a major milestone in your Python programming education. Here's a short summary of the objectives you've covered and got familiar with in Module 1:

- working with Python modules; importing, creating, and using modules;
- using selected Python STL modules (math, random, and platform)
constructing and using packages in Python;

You are now ready to take the module quiz and attempt the final challenge: Module 1 Test, which will help you gauge what you've learned so far.
